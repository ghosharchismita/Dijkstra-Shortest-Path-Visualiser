### Purpose of the project
This project is meant to help the user visualise the Shortest path from starting point to ending point in a grid with hurdles or walls as created by the user. 

It uses the very popular Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path.

It is built in form of a game using the pygame module of python wihere the user is first shown a menu with the start, instructions and quit buttons and directs the user as per his convenience.
The instructions provide the user with the information about how to start the visualiser and then he can go back and start the visualiser to see how it works.

It is a nice and interactive visual demonstration of the Dijkstra's Algorithm that we very commonly use.

### Setup of the project 
This project built using Python uses the Pygame library of Python (for graphics and interactive elements). 
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. Install Pygame if not already installed: pip install pygame
4. Run the main script
5. Follow on-screen instructions.

### Outcome of the project
The project can help a coding enthusiast to understand the working of the Dijkstra's algorithm as pictorial representations are always the best ways to understand algorithms. The algorithm's execution is animated step-by-step to demonstrate how it progresses towards finding the shortest path.
