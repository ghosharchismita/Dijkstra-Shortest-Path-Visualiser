### A demonstration of the Dijkstra's Algorithm
This project is meant to help the user visualise the Shortest path from starting point to ending point in a grid with hurdles or walls as created by the user. 

It uses the very popular Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path.

It is built in form of a game using the pygame module of python wihere the user is first shown a menu eith the start, instructions and quit buttons and directs the user as per his convenience.
The instructions provide the user with the information about how to xtart the visualiser and then he can go back and start the visualiser to see how it works.

It is a nice and interactive visual demonstration of the Dijkstra's Algorithm that we very commonly use.

You can very easily download the zip file and run the program in your machine to see how it works.
